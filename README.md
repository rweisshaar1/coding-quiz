# Coding Quiz Project

## Purpose:
- For this project, I wanted to create a mulitple choice quiz, that would demonstrate my skills of JavaScript and CSS.

## Instructions for Use:
- When the page first loads, there is a text box, and a button that says start. When the button is pushed, the quiz begins, along with a timer. If the timer hits zero, you have to restart the quiz.
- The first question will appear. If you get the answer correct, you will receive points, and a display in the bottom left corner will let you know you were correct.
- If you were incorrect, you will get no points, and you will lose 5 seconds on the timer.
- If an answer is not selected, a message will ask you to please select an answer.

- This will continue until the quiz is complete. Then a box will appear, and ask for you to enter your intials. 
- After that, you click the button twice, and it displays the score page, keeping track of all of your scores.

- Then, you reload the page, and continue to take the quiz.
